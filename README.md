# <Sing-Along>

## Description
This project was built as a way for someone to search for the lyrics of their favorite songs to give them the ability to sing along!
This project solves information on sings, artists, and lyrics not being displayed in a digestible manner.
This project is a summarization of all we learned for phase 1 of the UoT coding bootcamp. With an emphasis on utilizing third party APIs.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Installation

No installation required, runs in browser, saves to local storage, and automatically authorize user access.

## Usage
Search a song name in the search bar.
The website displays the song name, artist name, album cover, and lyrics.
